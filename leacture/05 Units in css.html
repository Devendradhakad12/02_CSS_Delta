   <!--!  Absolute -> px,pt,pc,cm,mm,in -->
   <!--*      96px = 1 In
    72pt = 1 In 
    12pt = 1pc -->
    <!--!  Relative -> %,em,rem,ch,vh,vw etc... -->
    % -> it is often used to define a size as relative to an element's parent object
         eg: width:33% // relative to the parent
 
         
    em -> Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like( font-size), and font size of the element itself,in the case of other properties like (width).  
    drawback og em -> snowball effect in nested elements
    
    rem -> relative to font size of the root element. Similar to M but does not have the snowball effect.
